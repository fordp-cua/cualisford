<h1>Exploring Open Library</h1>

<h2>Open Library Basics</h2> 

<p><a href="http://openlibrary.org">Openlibrary.org</a> is a digital library project attached to the non-profit, Internet Archive. Their goal is cataloging, and making available, every book ever published.  Books are added via both digital collection donations and by digitizing physical book donations.  The website itself is an open project, utilizing a wiki-style platform of open software, data, and documentation.  Like Wikipedia, every listing can be edited by users, as well as being made from scratch.  Besides user edits, they also have 7 branches of volunteers they recruit for specifically: librarians, communications team, software engineers, designers, accessibility specialists, translators, and beta participants. Outside of volunteer work to keep the project going, there is some grant funding from the California State Library and the Kahle/Austin Foundation.  They also receive money from affiliate links if users purchase books through their website links. 
</p>

<h2>Who is Open Library for?</h2>

<p>The users for this system are meant to be readers and researchers from anywhere in the world.  Users can make an account, allowing them to read books, check out books, make lists, edit listings, and more.  Currently the website can only be viewed in 14 languages, but one of the 7 branches of volunteers is translating the website into new languages.  Volunteers can be anywhere in the world and uploaded collections can be in any language.  They also have a branch of volunteers who work on making the website and the books accessible, including making books Digital Accessible Information SYstem (DAISY) compatible.</p> 

<h2>What can be found on Open Library?</h2>
 
<p>Open Library has over 20 million book records so far.  Listings vary from sparse, to well filled out. Listings include general book information found in most library listings, as well as languages available, community reviews, lists it is has been added to, and identification numbers for a variety of other websites like Amazon and Goodreads.  Book listings will have 3 options for viewing: read, checkout to read(count towards limit), or preview(not availible on Open Library).  Previews will link to <a href="http://worldcat.org">worldcat.org</a>, allowing the reader to see locations to borrow the book, both local and online libraries.
<br><br>Some of the unique features of the website include the Library Explorer browsing option.  It allows users to visually browse book covers by subject by scrolling “library shelves”, like they are in a physical library's non-fiction section. 
<br><br>The user profile is also feature rich.  Users can add to predetermined lists like “want to read” or make their own lists, like “reads for a summer holiday”.  Users can also set reading goals for the year.  Once books are marked as read, they are used to compile statistics so the user can explore their reading habits.  There is a similar section to view user contributions to editing the website.  If users make their profile public, other users can follow them and view their lists and book reviews. 
<br><br>The library also has a running display of statistics from the past 28 days that show an impresive amount of activity happening on the site. Below is a snapshot from the website on Oct 2, 2025.

<h2>Pros and Cons of this library</h2>

<h3>Pros</h3>

<ul> 
<li>The website is completely free, is available in multiple languages, and has an intuitive interface (utilitarian, but not unattractive).</li> 
<li>If they do not have the book to check out in their collection, they do a great job linking you to where you can borrow or purchase if that is possible.</li>
<li>They have good training materials to help volunteers who want to help but don't have previous coding experience.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Cons</h3>

<ul>
<li>Because it is a user edited, wiki style website, there will always be the possibility of misinformation being added to listings.</li>  
<li>Many listings are added as bulk collections, so they are only as good as the system they came from until someone comes along to edit them.</li>
<li> With millions of entries, some will invariably be left in need of editing for long periods of time.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Suggestions for improvement</h2>
<p>They should consider updating what the user profiles can display to other users.  Currently it is only your books lists, and as a global website, it would be interesting if users had the option to add a little bit of information about themselves.
<br><br>Another update that might be worth considering is their safety preferences.  Currently the only option is to blur covers that have been flagged as having sensitive imagery.  I think it would be worth having an option for users to select preferences for content that could be flagged in the same way they do with imagery. Although I concede, it would be a large undertaking to set that up.
