<h1>Evaluating <em>The Tower</em> Archive 1922-2018
</h1>
<div class="my-element">
<h2>Overview
</h2> 
</div>

<p><a href="https://www.jstor.org/site/catholic-university/tower/?so=item_title_str_asc&searchkey=1763062655390"><em>The Tower</em> archive</a> is repository of The Catholic University of America's school paper.  This archive contains the issues from the beginning of the newspaper in 1922 and stops in 2018 when the newspaper became a digital publication.  This database is housed in JSTOR and is accessible with an institutional or personal account. To evaluate this archive for usability it was put through a series of mini-usability tests between myself and a volunteer tester.  Using the results of those I was able to explore the archive and it's functionality. The first analysis I did was a simple Input-Output functionality test you will see below.  Then following the mini-usability tests, I completed a Nielsen heuristic review and established it's strengths and weaknesses. Finally I am going to compare the results of the heuristic review and mini-usability tests.

<h2>Heuristic Analysis
</h2>

<div class="my-list li">
<ol type="1">

<li><b>Visibility of System Status</b>
</li>
  <p>When downloading an issue of <em>The Tower</em> it can be “slow” but there is a blue loading bar across the top of the page.<br>Otherwise, most clicks provide a quick enough response a loading bar is not necessary.
<br><br>
</p>
<li><b>Match Between System and the Real World</b>
</li>

<p>
The JSOTR pages for <em>The Tower</em> do not have any language options embedded in the site. If a user does not speak English, they would need to translate the page themselves and hope that was enough. The only functional link that might be unknown to a user is the “Workbook” button but it has a bookmark icon to help key the user in that it is a way to save research. And when you click on it, it goes to a page that explains what Workbook is and how it works. The search bar has a magnifying glass icon to signify it is a search bar. “Log In” has a person icon.  Menus are indicated  with 3 horizontal dashes, which has become standard. The page formatting fits standard webpages with a header  with “Log in”, a search bar, and a menu tab and the footer containing standard information like “About Us” “Help Center”.
<br><br>
</p>

<li><b>User Control and Freedom</b>
</li>
<p>
Checking the top left box above a <em>Tower</em> year group icon will refresh the page with two new buttons : “cite” and “save”.  To revert back to the previous layout the user can click on “Clear selections” on the right side of the screen.   
If the user is on the page for an individual issue and chooses to download an issue of <em>The Tower</em>, the pop-up allows the user to cancel the action the first time, but after that the article automatically downloads on a new page.  The other two options, “Cite”  is a pop-up box with an x-out in the top right and “Save” pops up with the option to “Save” or “Cancel”. 
When in one of the smaller year groupings of <em>The Tower</em> archive, the user can return to the main page by clicking on “The Tower” a text link at the top of the page.
<br><br>
</p>

<li><b>Consistency and Standards</b>
</li>  
<p>
The website itself has a simple layout with easy-to-follow prompts.  It follows the standard database layout with sorting functions and the ability to refine results.   The top of the page has a navigation path that can  take the user back to the results or to the landing page for <em>The Tower </em> archive and if you searched in one of the specific time blocks, to that landing page. 
When the user searches for a term and goes into an issue from the search, it  doesn’t go to the part of the issue that has the search term.  Sometimes the menu of information next to the issue lists the page the term was found on, but it doesn’t always do this.   
<br><br>
</p>

<li><b>Error prevention</b>
</li>
<p>
There is some error correction if the users search term is spelled incorrectly it usually gives the prompt “Did you mean: ________”
If the user search has 0 results the page offers the following suggestions:
<br>
*Check your spelling
<br>
*Broaden your search by selecting "All content"
<br>
*Clear your search filters
<br>
*See Search Help
However, there were often no search results for terms that I verified were in articles. There seems to be some issues with the index the search box is pulling from.
<br>
I also found the website did an autofill that activly caused user errors. Because this archive is hosted in JSTOR the page always has a seach box for <em>The Tower</em> and "All Content" on JSTOR. When a user searches in <em>The Tower</em>, the website fills that search text into the "All Content" search box.  So if a user doesn't notice this and they just click into the box with their search term and run a new search, they will find that they are searching all of JSTOR and not just <em>The Tower</em>.

<br><br>


</p>

<li><b>Recognition rather Than Recall</b>
</li>
<p>
The site uses a standard website layout, menus, help, log-in, etc. are all in normal places a user would look.  The search functions are simplistic and similar to most other databases.  All menus are well labeled.  Hovering over icons produces a text explanation of their function. 
<br><br>
</p>
 
<li><b>Flexibility and Efficiency of Use</b>
</li> 
<p>
There do not seem to be shortcuts or customization options for advanced users.  If they exist, they are not advertised.
<br><br>
</p>
   
<li><b>Aesthetic and Minimalist Design</b>
</li>
<p>
Website is a simple white, black, and red color scheme.  No extra imagery.  The “Refine Results” on the left side is bulky and cannot be collapsed.  For <em>The Tower</em> archive, this is specifically bothersome because only 2 of the 4 of the categories have the ability to filter the results, and minimally at that. 
The search filters are too minimal to be useful. For example, in later years there were other versions of the paper, <em>Tower Jr</em> and <em>The Towel</em>, these are not explained in the in the Description of the Issues or the paper as a whole, and there is no toggle filter for these versions in the filter menu. If a user does not know about those other versions, they may not see them, or waste time figuring out what they are.  The archive landing page even uses a thumbnail photo of <em>The Towel</em> for the section labeled “The Tower newspaper 2000-2020”, but offers not explanation for what <em>The Towel</em> is anywhere in the archives “About this collection” or “Item details”.

</figure>	

<br><br>

<li><b>Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover from Errors</b>
</li>
<p>
Sometimes when getting on the archive there is a loading error.  There is a page that loads that says “We are unable to process your request at this time. If this error continues, please contact JSTOR support.” “Contact JSTOR support” is a clickable link.  The resolves with reloading the page most times, which is not explicitly recommended but implied as an option for resolving the error. 
<br><br>
</p>

<li><b>Help and Documentation</b>
</li>
<p>At the top of the page near the search bar, there is a clickable link “Search Help” that takes you to JSOR’s “Search Help: Resources &Overview” page that has 13 different pages for specific search topics.  It seems to be very thorough and would help someone who isn’t familiar with academic research databases.  
There is also a “Help Center” menu in the footer that links to more help features including general issues like website trouble shooting and a LibGuide page with a broad range of topics related to JSTOR and academic research.

<h2>Strengths and Weaknesses determined during evaluation
</h2>

<h3>Strengths
</h3>
<ul> 
<li>The simplicity of the website makes it easy to use. Every issue is available to open and download. And the ability to filter by year allows the user to slim down the number of issues.
</li>
<br>
<li>The viewer for the newspaper issues has nice features for viewing.  There is an option to have thumbnails of each page on the left side for quick navigation. The paper can be zoomed allowing the user to make the often small newspaper front of the older editions readable.  The newspaper can also be put into full-screen mode for the best readability.  The text can be selected and moved into a document.
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Weaknesses</h3>
<ul>
<li>The search box does not function properly.  Terms that should have brought up multiple hits during evaluation showed zero results.  This seems to be an issue with the pre-2000 issues in the archive.  I expect this may have something to do with the original file type switching from photocopies of physical papers to digital files. However, even the old issues can be searched by keyword if you are in an individual issue of the newspaper, so something is wrong with the wider archive search.
</li> 
<br> 
<li>The filter offerings could be more useful.  Other than date, none of the current options actually filter the results.  For example, there should be filter options for “The Tower” “Tower Jr” and “The Towel”.  And those should be talked about in the description of the archive. Being able to filter down to a specific month would also be useful.
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Findings: Heuristic Review vs Mini-usability Test</h2>
<p>While the mini-usability tests gave me a foundational knowledge of the website for the heuristic review, they are separate pieces of a bigger picture. The usability testing gave me a better understanding of the indepth funcionality of the website and how that realated the the user experience. I had a difficult time getting any search results to come up in the archives, with almost all my options being post 2000. I even started searching headline terms from specific articles just to make sure I was correct. Having a second tester allowed me to verifty issues those search issues but also showed me issues I had not noticed.  While my user was getting a feel for the website, i noticed they kept zooming-in on the page and complaning about how hard some of it was to see. They also notied <em>The Towel</em> photo and started digging to find out what that was. Their main takeaway was that while the website was simple to use and quick to figure out, the search functionality made it almost useless.  While i think the huristic review can give a good overview of the website, several of it's principles are overlaping and so broad, you might miss small but important issues that a usability test might pick up on.  Doing both of them and then synthisising the information together gives a fuller picture of the usability and functionality of a website.
